These are the high-res DEM, the roughness data (not strictly needed, a default will be used when no argument is provided), and river data (although we don't use this in our example). Finally we need to specify the number of subgrid cells in each grid cell (lateral size, total nr of subgrid pixels per cell is `nr_subgrid_pixels`<sup>2</sup>). This we want to match our DEM resolution as close as possible. In our example the grid resolution is 200m while the DEM resolution is 1arcsec ~ 30m, so we will use `nr_subgrid_pixels` = 6, as 200m/6 is slightly more than 30m.\n",
